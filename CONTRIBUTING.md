# Contributing to Quickdraw

Thanks for helping! All contributors are expected to follow the
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). A few things keep this codebase what
it is:

## Principles

- **Zero runtime dependencies in the core.** The engine is plain ESM that runs
  in any modern browser without a build step. Anything that would add a
  dependency needs a very good reason.
- **Records are immutable.** An update replaces the record object; diffs hold
  `[from, to]` pairs that must stay true. Never mutate a record in place.
- **One undo entry per gesture.** Bracket multi-transaction gestures with
  `beginBatch()` / `endBatch()`.
- **The diff is the wire format.** Changes to its shape are breaking changes
  for every sync and persistence consumer.

## Working on it

```bash
npm install
npm test                # vitest, all packages
npm run dev             # react demo playground
npm run typecheck       # keep types/index.d.ts honest
npm run build           # regenerate the RN WebView bundle after core changes
```

`examples/vanilla/index.html` (served statically from the repo root) is the
fastest way to poke the raw engine.

## Pull requests

- Add or update tests for what you change — engine behavior lives in
  `packages/core/test`, protocol behavior in `packages/react-native/test`.
- Hand-written type declarations live in each package's `types/index.d.ts`;
  update them together with API changes.
- Keep comments in the existing voice: explain *why*, not *what*.
